## Data Structures and Algorithms Agenda
- [] Review Big O notation
- [] Review how to break down an algorithm question
- [] Sort an array manually (no .sort()!) using JavaScript

*BREAK FOR GUEST SPEAKER*

- [] Discuss Singly Linked Lists, how they are similar and different from arrays
- [] Implement a linked list in Ruby

### BIG O time complexity
>Note: the following video has flashing lights and colors - also I recommend muting the volume, it isn't necessary to view the sorting algorithms as they run.

### What Is Time Complexity? 
    The amount of time it takes an algo to run.

 - O(1) Constant 
 - O(n) Linear time
 - O(log n) [Logarithmic time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ubFru2O80) 
 - O(n^2) Quadratic time 
 - O(n^n) Exponential time

 ### Popular Data Structures for DS&A Qs
 - Arrays 
 - LinkedList
 - Hash
 - Stacks/Queues 
 - Trees 
    - Binary Trees
 - Graphs 

 ### How to approach a DS&A question

 - Write the question down and confirm your assumptions  
 - Write out/explain steps for the solution before coding 
 - Code out solution 
 - Run test case examples 
 - Give Big - O

****

Given an array [2, 9, 1, 3] create a custom method/function to sort the array without using a built in sort method such as .sort.

Once done, do it again but using another algorithm.
